    <h2>Annotaties</h2>

  <div class="text-content">
    <h1 tabindex="0">kop1</h1>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s1">It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel
      in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded
      with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all
      in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of
      being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their
      time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow
      up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country,
      to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s2">I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in
      the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of
      their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great
      additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and
      easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the
      commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set
      up for a preserver of the nation.</p>

      <h2 tabindex="0">kop2</h2>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s3">But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
      children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take
      in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in
      effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the
      streets.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s4">As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
      important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors,
      I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a
      child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year,
      with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings,
      which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful
      occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to
      provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their
      parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their
      lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to
      the clothing of many thousands.</p>
      <h3 tabindex="0">kop3</h3>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s5">There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent
      those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their
      bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent
      babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move
      tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s6">The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a
      half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple,
      whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple,
      who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot
      be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being
      granted, there will remain a hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again
      subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by
      accident or disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty
      thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How
      this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have already said,
      under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the
      methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or
      agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate
      land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at
      six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they
      learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be
      properly looked upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a
      principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never
      knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the
      kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.</p>

      <h4 tabindex="0">kop4</h4>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s7">I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old,
      is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not
      yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the
      exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the
      charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s8">I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be
      liable to the least objection.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s9">I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,
      that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious
      nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I
      make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" id="s10">I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred
      and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved
      for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we
      allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children
      are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our
      savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
      remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
      persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother
      to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and
      fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for
      friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a
      reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good
      boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.</p>
